# 1. INNER JOIN

/*

-- Combines rows from two tables where a specified condition is met.
-- Returns only matching rows.

Syntax:

SELECT columns 
FROM table1 
INNER JOIN table2 
ON table1.column = table2.column;

Example: Find customers with orders.

*/

# 2. LEFT (OUTER) JOIN

/*

-- Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
-- Non-matching rows in the right table appear as NULL.

Syntax:

SELECT columns 
FROM table1 
LEFT JOIN table2 
ON table1.column = table2.column;

Example: List all customers, including those without orders.

*/

# 3. RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN

/* 

-- Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
-- Non-matching rows in the left table appear as NULL.

Syntax:

SELECT columns 
FROM table1 
RIGHT JOIN table2 
ON table1.column = table2.column;

Example: List all orders, including ones without associated customers.

*/
# 4. FULL (OUTER) JOIN (NOT SUPPORTED IN MYSQL)

/* 

Combines LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.

Returns all rows when there is a match in either table.
Non-matching rows are filled with NULL.

Syntax:

SELECT columns 
FROM table1 
FULL OUTER JOIN table2 
ON table1.column = table2.column;

#Example: Find all customers and orders, including unmatched entries.

*/

# 5. CROSS JOIN

/*

Produces a Cartesian product of two tables (every row in table1 is joined with every row in table2).

Syntax:

SELECT columns 
FROM table1 
CROSS JOIN table2;

Example: Pair all products with all suppliers.

*/

# 6. SELF JOIN

/*

Joins a table to itself using table aliases.
Useful for hierarchical or comparative data.

Syntax:

SELECT a.column, b.column 
FROM table a 
INNER JOIN table b 
ON a.column = b.column;

Example: Compare employees to their managers.
*/

# Key Points

-- Joins use ON for conditions; 
-- conditions can include multiple columns.
-- Performance depends on indexing and table size.
-- Use appropriate joins to optimize query results and prevent unnecessary data processing.


# FULL OUTER JOIN 

/* 

FULL OUTER JOIN is not supported in some databases like MySQL (as of now).

However, if you're using MySQL and want the equivalent of a FULL OUTER JOIN, you can achieve this using a UNION ALL of a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN as follows:

For databases that do not support FULL OUTER JOIN (e.g., MySQL):

SELECT owners.owner, tools.tool
FROM owners
LEFT JOIN tools ON owners.owner_id = tools.owner_id
UNION ALL
SELECT owners.owner, tools.tool
FROM owners
RIGHT JOIN tools ON owners.owner_id = tools.owner_id;

*/

# RIGHT JOIN is equivalent to LEFT JOIN with reversed table positions

# These below queries will end up returing same results by changing postions & join types (left <-> right)

select * from ITEmployees e right join ITDepartment d on e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

select * from ITDepartment d left join ITEmployees e on d.dept_id = e.dept_id;

# These below queries will end up returing same results by changing postions & join types (left <-> right)

SELECT b.id as book_id, b.title as book_name, a.id as author_id, a.name as author_name FROM `books` as b left join authors as a on b.author_id = a.id;

SELECT b.id as book_id, b.title as book_name, a.id as author_id, a.name as author_name FROM `authors` as a right join books as b on a.id=b.author_id;

# These below queries will end up returing same results by changing postions & join types (left <-> right)

SELECT b.id as book_id, b.title as book_name, a.id as author_id, a.name as author_name FROM `books` as b right join authors as a on b.author_id = a.id;

SELECT b.id as book_id, b.title as book_name, a.id as author_id, a.name as author_name FROM `authors` as a left join books as b on a.id=b.author_id;

/*

    Schema : authors has many books, books belong to authors.

    On using left join & right join, 
        -- if primary table is belong_to table then the result count will be same as this tables count.
        -- if primary table us has_many table then the result count will be more, because author will appears X times in result as BOOKS COUNT (X).
            -- if 0 books then 1 time, if 1 book then 1 time, it more than 1 then that many times.

    Revised Statement of above :

    If the primary table is the belongs_to table (e.g., books):

    The result count will always equal the count of the books table.
    This is because each row in books is included, regardless of whether it has a matching author.
    If the primary table is the has_many table (e.g., authors):

    The result count will depend on the relationships:
    Authors with no books appear once.
    Authors with 1 book appear once.
    Authors with multiple books appear once for each book they have.
    So, the result count will generally be greater than or equal to the count of the authors table, depending on how many books exist.

FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENT (GROUP BY):

SELECT w1.name AS Worker1,

FROM workers w1 
LEFT JOIN workers w2 
  ON w1.salary >= w2.salary AND w1.id != w2.id 
GROUP BY w1.id 
ORDER BY w1.id;


This groups the results by w1.id (the worker in question).
Since w1.id is the grouping column, it's okay to use w1.name in the SELECT clause without explicitly adding it to GROUP BY. This is allowed because w1.name is functionally dependent on w1.id â€” meaning for every unique w1.id, there's only one corresponding w1.name.
This is a standard behavior in SQL. As long as the non-aggregated columns are dependent on the GROUP BY column (here w1.id), they can be included in the SELECT without being part of the GROUP BY clause.

SELECT item.item_name FROM `item` GROUP by item.item_id;
