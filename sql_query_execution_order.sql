In MySQL (and SQL in general), the order of execution of a query follows a specific sequence, 
which is not the same as the order of clauses written in the query. 
Understanding this order is crucial for optimizing queries and debugging.

Here is the correct order of execution for a typical SQL query:

1. FROM and JOIN clauses
The first step in query execution is determining the data source and combining tables (if using JOIN).

This step involves:
Reading the tables and performing any joins specified (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN).
If the query has multiple tables, they are joined together based on the conditions in the ON clause.

2. WHERE clause
The WHERE clause filters the rows that are retrieved from the FROM and JOIN steps.
This step removes any rows that do not meet the conditions defined in the WHERE clause.

3. GROUP BY clause
The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
After the WHERE filter is applied, rows are grouped based on the columns in the GROUP BY clause.

4. HAVING clause
The HAVING clause is applied after GROUP BY to filter out groups.
This allows you to filter groups based on aggregated values (e.g., HAVING COUNT(*) > 1).
It works similarly to the WHERE clause but for grouped results.

5. SELECT clause
The SELECT clause is used to specify which columns to retrieve (including aggregated columns).
This is where column expressions are evaluated, and only the specified columns are returned in the result set.

6. DISTINCT keyword
If DISTINCT is used, it is applied after the SELECT step to eliminate duplicate rows from the result set.

7. ORDER BY clause
The ORDER BY clause sorts the rows returned by the query based on the specified columns.
It is applied after selecting the data but before the final result is returned.

8. LIMIT clause
The LIMIT clause is applied last. It restricts the number of rows returned by the query.
If the query has an OFFSET, it is applied as part of the LIMIT operation, starting from the specified position.

Summary of the Order of Execution:
FROM / JOIN – Retrieve data from the tables.
WHERE – Filter rows based on conditions.
GROUP BY – Group the rows.
HAVING – Filter groups (after GROUP BY).
SELECT – Select the columns and expressions.
DISTINCT – Eliminate duplicate rows (if applicable).
ORDER BY – Sort the rows.
LIMIT / OFFSET – Restrict the number of rows returned.

# Example Query:

SELECT a.name, COUNT(*)
FROM authors AS a
JOIN books AS b ON a.id = b.author_id
WHERE YEAR(b.published_date) > 2000
GROUP BY a.id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY a.name
LIMIT 10;

/*

The order of execution would be:

FROM / JOIN – First, the authors and books tables are joined.
WHERE – Then, rows where the published_date > 2000 condition is applied are kept.
GROUP BY – The remaining rows are grouped by a.id (author).
HAVING – Groups having more than one book (COUNT(*) > 1) are kept.
SELECT – The name of the author and the count of books are selected.
DISTINCT – Not applicable here, since DISTINCT is not used.
ORDER BY – The results are ordered by a.name.
LIMIT – The first 10 rows are returned.

Conclusion:

The actual order of execution in MySQL queries follows a logical sequence designed to optimize how data is retrieved, filtered, grouped, and presented. 
Understanding this order helps in writing more efficient queries and avoiding mistakes, such as filtering groups with WHERE instead of HAVING.
